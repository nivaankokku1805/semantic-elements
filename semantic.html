        In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some
        usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are
        usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and
        bamboos are also trees.
        
        Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have independently
        evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of tree species
        are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some trees
        reaching several thousand years old. Trees evolved around 370 million years ago, and it is estimated that there are
        around three trillion mature trees in the world currently.
        
        A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk, which typically contains woody
        tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees the
        trunk is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and
        spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the
        branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and
        convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.
        
        Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowering plants have their seeds inside fruits, while conifers carry their seeds
        in cones, and tree ferns produce spores instead.
        
        Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the
        atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species
        of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and
        shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In
        much of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture.
        Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and
        they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.
        
        Definition
        
        Diagram of secondary growth in a eudicot or coniferous tree showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new
        layer of wood is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots.
        Although "tree" is a common word, there is no universally recognised precise definition of what a tree is, either
        botanically or in common language.[1][2] In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of an
        elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.[3]
        Trees are also typically defined by height,[4] with smaller plants from 0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called
        shrubs,[5] so the minimum height of a tree is only loosely defined.[4] Large herbaceous plants such as papaya and
        bananas are trees in this broad sense.[2][6]
        
        A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk formed by secondary growth, meaning that the
        trunk thickens each year by growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards growth from the growing tip.[4][7]
        Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as palms, bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless of
        their height, growth form or stem girth. Certain monocots may be considered trees under a slightly looser definition;[8]
        while the Joshua tree, bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and never produce true wood with growth
        rings,[9][10] they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying cells formed by primary growth.[11] Tree species in the genus
        Dracaena, despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth caused by meristem in their trunk, but it is different
        from the thickening meristem found in dicotyledonous trees.[12]
        
        Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use; for instance, as those plants which yield
        lumber.[13]

        Saplings (Weeds).
        The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different groups of plants: by growing taller, trees are
        able to compete better for sunlight.[14] Trees tend to be tall and long-lived,[15] some reaching several thousand years
        old.[16] Several trees are among the oldest organisms now living.[17] Trees have modified structures such as thicker
        stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and durability, allowing them to grow taller than many
        other plants and to spread out their foliage. They differ from shrubs, which have a similar growth form, by usually
        growing larger and having a single main stem;[5] but there is no consistent distinction between a tree and a shrub,[18]
        made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in size under harsher environmental conditions such as on
        mountains and subarctic areas. The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in response to
        similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example of parallel evolution. With an estimated 60,000-100,000
        species, the number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five per cent of all living plant species.[19][20] The
        greatest number of these grow in tropical regions; many of these areas have not yet been fully surveyed by botanists,
        making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.[21]
        
        
        Tall herbaceous monocotyledonous plants such as banana lack secondary growth, but are trees under the broadest
        definition.
        The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods. Of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwood trees;[22]
        these include conifers, cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales, which produce seeds which are not enclosed in fruits, but in
        open structures such as pine cones, and many have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles.[23] Most angiosperm trees are
        eudicots, the "true dicotyledons", so named because the seeds contain two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also some
        trees among the old lineages of flowering plants called basal angiosperms or paleodicots; these include Amborella,
        Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado,[24] while trees such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.
        
        Wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most types of tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger. The
        vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it
        trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees need to draw water high up the stem through the xylem from
        the roots by capillary action, as water continually evaporates from the leaves in the process of transpiration. If
        insufficient water is available the leaves will die.[25] The three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and
        leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells. In trees and other
        plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth.
        Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the
        phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss.
        Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.[26]
        
        Trees are either evergreen, having foliage that persists and remains green throughout the year,[27] or deciduous,
        shedding their leaves at the end of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage.[28] Most
        conifers are evergreens, but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some
        species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as
        cladoptosis.[5] The crown is the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves,[29] while the uppermost
        layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy.[30] A sapling is a young tree.[31]
        
        Many tall palms are herbaceous[32] monocots, which do not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood.[9][10] In
        many tall palms, the terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large
        spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to 20 metres
        (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous
        adventitious roots.[33]
